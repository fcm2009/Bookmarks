  abstract = {Requirements such as distribution or tracing have an impact on multiple
	classes in a system. They are cross-cutting requirements, or aspects.
	Their support is, by necessity, scattered across those multiple classes.
	A look at an individual class may also show support for cross-cutting
	requirements tangled up with the core responsibilities of that class.
	Scattering and tangling make object-oriented software difficult to
	understand, extend and reuse. Though design is an important activity
	within the software lifecycle with well-documented benefits, those
	benefits are reduced when cross-cutting requirements are present.
	This paper presents a means to mitigate these problems by separating
	the design of cross-cutting requirements into composition patterns.
	Composition patterns require extensions to the UML, and are based
	on a combination of the subjectoriented model for composing separate,
	overlapping designs, and UML templates. This paper also demonstrates
	how composition patterns map to one programming model that provides
	a solution for separation of cross-cutting requirements in code-
	aspect-oriented programming. This mapping serves to illustrate that
	separation of aspects may be maintained throughout the software lifecycle.},

  abstract = {MultiJava is a conservative extension of the Java programming language
	that adds symmetric multiple dispatch and open classes. Among other
	benefits, multiple dispatch provides a solution to the binary method
	problem. Open classes provide a solution to the extensibility problem
	of object-oriented programming languages, allowing the modular addition
	of both new types and new operations to an existing type hierarchy.
	This article illustrates and motivates the design of MultiJava and
	describes its modular static typechecking and modular compilation
	strategies. Although MultiJava extends Java, the key ideas of the
	language design are applicable to other object-oriented languages,
	such as C\# and C++, and even, with some modifications, to functional
	languages such as ML. This article also discusses the variety of
	application domains in which MultiJava has been successfully used
	by others, including pervasive computing, graphical user interfaces,
	and compilers. MultiJava allows users to express desired programming
	idioms in a way that is declarative and supports static typechecking,
	in contrast to the tedious and type-unsafe workarounds required in
	Java. MultiJava also provides opportunities for new kinds of extensibility
	that are not easily available in Java.},

	in software engineering, called ``separation of concerns'', which
	tries to formally separate the basic algorithm from special purpose
	concerns such as synchronization, real-time constraints, and location
	control. This separation allows for the locality of different kinds
	of information in the programs, making them easier to write, understand,
	and modify. We identify the major concerns existing in today's software
	applications, and analyze recent proposals in the literature that
	address single concerns. Furthermore, we study the commonalities
	of these proposals and discuss how they can be used to achieve separation
	of concerns in general. Finally, we address the problem of composition
	of several separated concerns.},

  abstract = {By providing a macro facility, languages such as Scheme and Common
	Lisp allow users to define new special forms as local, syntactic
	program transformations. This allows users to abstract away what
	would otherwise be repetitive or cumbersome syntax. One limitation
	to the power of macro facilities is that only textual local transformations
	can be defined -- the user cannot, for example, define a delay macro
	which automatically inserts calls to force at all required points
	in the program. In this paper, we present a new kind of macro, called
	a data path macro, in which transformations can take place at any
	point along the dataflow path that includes the macro invocation.
	The heart of the data path macro facility is a dataflow analysis
	mechanism that allows the user to easily request powerful data flow
	analyses.},

  abstract = {Polyglot is an extensible compiler framework that supports the easy
	creation of compilers for languages similar to Java, while avoiding
	code duplication. The Polyglot framework is useful for domain-specific
	languages, exploration of language design, and for simplified versions
	of Java for pedagogical use. We have used Polyglot to implement several
	major and minor modifications to Java; the cost of implementing language
	extensions scales well with the degree to which the language differs
	from Java. This paper focuses on the design choices in Polyglot that
	are important for making the framework usable and highly extensible.
	Polyglot source code is available.},

	iterator flattening, and traversal state reduction, are used to improve
	performance of the generated iterators. A case study demonstrates
	that most of the iterators in the widely used JDK Collections classes
	can be replaced with code synthesized from declarative abstraction
	functions. These synthesized iterators perform competitively with
	the hand-written originals. In a user study the synthesized iterators
	always passed more test cases than the hand-written ones, were almost
	always as efficient, usually took less programmer effort, and were
	the qualitative preference of all participants who provided free-form
	comments.},

  review = {AspectJ is a so-called general-purpose aspect-language which tries
	to solve the problem of crosscutting code. An often uttered criticism
	of AspectJ is that there is no underlying concept in the implemented
	language features and that those features are rather arbitrary
	
	 chosen instead of being based on any theoretical foundations. This
	paper shows beyond the the context of crosscutting and tangling code
	how known concepts in objectoriented programming languages can be
	implemented in AspectJ and argues in that way that AspectJ generalizes
	a large variety of features which are already known in the objectoriented
	world. The argumentation is based on the concepts of mixin classes,
	multidispatching and negative type information which can be implemented
	by using a small set of AspectJ idioms},

	blur the clear structure, destroy the intended independence, or introduce
	undue administrative overhead. Each alternative creates a dierent
	caricature of the originally crisp architecture. The programming
	model Object Teams provides a new modeling unit called Team plus
	a number of binding mechanisms by which a Team and its contained
	roles can be bound to existing parts of an application. It turns
	out that these mechanisms fit nicely for implementing a clear model-view
	-controller design not only for single elements but also for complex
	structures of GUI elements plus their binding to complex model structures.
	We furthermore propose to use the model-view-controller paradigm
	as a benchmark for AOSD approaches, since it combines a set of typical
	problems concerning the separation and integration of concerns.},

  abstract = {Contract4J is a developer tool written in AspectJ and Java that supports
	Design by Contract programming in these two languages. It is designed
	to be general purpose and to require minimal effort for adoption
	by users. For example, adoption requires little customization and
	prior experience with AspectJ. Writing Contract4J demonstrated several
	issues that exist when writing truly generic and reusable aspects
	using today's technologies. This paper discusses those experiences
	and comments on ways our understanding and tooling could improve
	to make it easier to write such aspects. In particular, I discuss
	the importance of migrating from syntax-based pointcut definitions
	to semantically-rich metaphors, similar to design patterns.},

  abstract = {A characteristic of aspect-oriented programming, as embodied in AspectJ,
	is the use of _advice_ to incrementally modify the behavior of a
	program. An advice declaration specifies an action to be taken whenever
	some condition arises during the execution of the program. The condition
	is specified by a formula called a _pointcut designator_ or _pcd_.
	The events during execution at which advice may be triggered are
	called _join points_. In this model of aspect-oriented programming,
	join points are dynamic in that they refer to events during the execution
	of the program. We give a denotational semantics for a minilanguage
	that embodies the key features of dynamic join points, pointcut designators,
	and advice.},
